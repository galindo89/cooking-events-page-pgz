## Introduction
### Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a website for a cooking event service organizer located in Hamburg, Germany. The website is designed to showcase the services and events offered, providing visitors with detailed information and easy navigation.

The main objective is to present a simple, user-friendly, multi-device compatible website that highlights the services provided and the value proposition of these services. Additionally, it includes a gallery displaying previous events and a contact form for users to make reservation requests.

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories

- As a potential client, I want to understand what types of cooking events are available, so that I can find an event that interests me.
- As a user, I want to contact the organizer through the website, so that I can ask questions or make a booking.
- As a visitor, I want to see images and descriptions of past events, so that I can get an idea of what to expect.
- As a user, I want to access the website on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), so that I can browse and book events conveniently from any device.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The color scheme was chosen to reflect the vibrant and inviting nature of our cooking events, inspired by the rich and diverse cultures of Mediterranean and Latin American cuisine. The selected colors aim to evoke warmth, energy, and a sense of festivity that aligns with the culinary experiences offered.

- Primary Color: `#E28A59` (Background, Buttons)
- Secondary Color: `#F3E542` (Text, Highlights)
- Accent Color: `#7A9E3B` (Hover States)
- Background Color: `#F4F4F4` (Body Background)
- Text Color: `#3A3A3A`

### Typography
For the typography, two primary fonts to enhance readability and complement the vibrant theme of our cooking events were chosen. The selected fonts aim to balance clarity with a touch of elegance, reflecting the high-quality and professional nature of our services. 

- 'Open Sans', sans-serif for general text for its readability and clean appearance.
- 'Merriweather Sans', sans-serif for headings to provide a distinct and stylish look.

### Imagery
Images were chosen to showcase the vibrant and interactive nature of our cooking events, including photos of past events and culinary creations.
