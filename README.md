## Introduction
### Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a website for a cooking event service organizer located in Hamburg, Germany. The website is designed to showcase the services and events offered, providing visitors with detailed information and easy navigation.

The main objective is to present a simple, user-friendly, multi-device compatible website that highlights the services provided and the value proposition of these services. Additionally, it includes a gallery displaying previous events and a contact form for users to make reservation requests.

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories
- As a visitor, I want to learn about the cooking event services offered, so that I can decide if I want to book an event.
- As a potential client, I want to understand what types of cooking events are available, so that I can find an event that interests me.
- As a user, I want to contact the organizer through the website, so that I can ask questions or make a booking.
- As a visitor, I want to see images and descriptions of past events, so that I can get an idea of what to expect.
- As a user, I want to access the website on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), so that I can browse and book events conveniently from any device.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The color scheme was chosen to reflect the vibrant and inviting nature of our cooking events, inspired by the rich and diverse cultures of Mediterranean and Latin American cuisine. The selected colors aim to evoke warmth, energy, and a sense of festivity that aligns with the culinary experiences offered.

- Primary Color: `#E28A59` (Background, Buttons)
- Secondary Color: `#F3E542` (Text, Highlights)
- Accent Color: `#7A9E3B` (Hover States)
- Background Color: `#F4F4F4` (Body Background)
- Text Color: `#3A3A3A`

### Typography
For the typography, two primary fonts to enhance readability and complement the vibrant theme of our cooking events were chosen. The selected fonts aim to balance clarity with a touch of elegance, reflecting the high-quality and professional nature of our services. 

- 'Open Sans', sans-serif for general text for its readability and clean appearance.
- 'Merriweather Sans', sans-serif for headings to provide a distinct and stylish look.

### Imagery
Images were chosen to showcase the vibrant and interactive nature of our cooking events, including photos of past events and culinary creations.

### Wireframes
During the design phase, wireframes were used to sketch the potential structure of the web page, especially for the mobile and desktop versions. The wireframes were hand-sketched. The following pictures show the sketches produced:

### Lighthouse Testing

Lighthouse testing was executed using the plugin from Chrome's developer tools. The tests were conducted for both mobile and desktop versions of the site. The test analyzed performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. 

The results show that for both mobile and desktop, accessibility, SEO, and best practices were excellent. However, there is room for improvement on the performance side for mobile. Although it was possible to increase the performance results for mobile by optimizing the hero image, additional steps are necessary.

Below are the results:
- For mobile before optimizing the hero image:

- For mobile after optimizing the hero image:
  - ![!Mobile Lighthouse Results After Fix](readme-docs/testing/lighthouse-test-mobile-after-fix.JPG)
- For desktop:
  - ![Desktop Lighthouse](readme-docs/testing/lighthouse-test-desktop.JPG)



### Bugs Documentation

During the implementation and testing phase of this project, there where several bugs identified and solved. The table  below presets the bugs identified. Consider please that during the implementation there were definitely more bugs, but they grudally solved while implementing and poloshing the page. Therefore they may not be listed here. 

| Bug                                                                                                               | How we solved it                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Status             |

| Original hero image of the home page was distorted. The faces of some of the people in the picture were stretched | We replaced the hero image with another one                                                                                                                                                                                | Fixed and deployed |
| Picture not displaying in the gallery section                                                                     | The picture got renamed and mistakenly deleted during the updates to the names of the folders to comply with naming conventions. We updated the corresponding image element in the gallery section and uploaded a new file | Fixed and deployed |
| Calendar icon in the calendar field of the Contact form not visible                                               | The icon's color was not contrasting with the form's background. This was due to how the web browser was rendering that icon. To solve the issue, it was necessary to hide the default icon and set up a new one.          | Fixed and deployed |



### Solved Bugs
See above.

### Known Bugs
As of now, after the testing conducted on this page, there are no known bugs. It is important to mention that during the Lighthouse testing, the performance of the web page for mobile provided several insights on specific sections of the web page that need to be improved.

## Credits
### Code Used
This web page was generated by the authr, using the skills and knowledge gathered during the modules of HTML and CSS. It is important to mention that although the majority of the code was produced by him, he guided himself specially the Love-Running project. In particular, the following two sections provided good examples to Mr. Galindo Zapata:

1. Gallery section
2. Hiding the nav bar for different screen sizes and creating a "burger" navigation menu.

Furthermore, there was an implementation to solve one of the bugs related to the calendar icon in the contact form. You can find a link to the code solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76844615/how-to-style-the-calendar-icon-in-a-date-input).
